Try (
   w/ resources:
   Connection ...
   Statement ...
   ResultSet ...
   **Don't need to close if used - no need for finally block
)

ResultSet Methods:

    last() - moves the cursor to the last row
    first() - moves cursor to the first row
    absolute(int row) - returns a specific row 

    **MYSQL produces a scrollable ResultSet; HSQLDB does not.  The options
      included in the Statement in Songs.java line 39 are to ensure that
      the ResultSet is scrollable no matter which DB is being used.

Statement methods:

    setMaxRows(int numberOfRows) **can't be within try w/ resources block

    **alternative:
        ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT ... FROM ... " + "LIMIT int numberOfRows"); || "LIMIT int startingRow, int numberOfRows" 
    
PreparedStatements:  JDBC Class that processes SQL queries with parameters

    "SELECT column FROM table WHERE artistName = ?";  <----- question mark represents a variable to be input
